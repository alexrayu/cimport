He finished off the auger with high-carbon steel bits and steel pipe handles. Perrin put this tool to use. His fellow workers saw how easily the auger worked and wanted their own  In.Perrin In. auger. In a short time, Art ran out of cylinder sleeves and started using stainless steel.

Safety,Rescue Equipment,CFS,BMS RESCUE RACK SHORT W/DUAL HYPER BARS,BMS Rescue-Racks are designed for the professional rope rescue user. Constructed entirely of high strength stainless steel these racks standup to the harshest of conditions. The closed frame yields a device many times stronger than it's open frame counterparts and the extra heavy tubular stainless steel bars stand up to severe abrasion. Top bars are of the double hyper-bar design which provides added load control options and simple and secure lock offs for either 1 or 2 ropes allowing independent control over both ropes. A slight variation on the 4 bar Rescue-Rack uses a second double hyper-bar in place of the third bar. This allows the operator to add extra wraps around the hyper-bars to increase friction to maintain control under demanding rescue conditions. Dimensions: 10”x 5”x .75” (254 x 127 x 19 mm).

HTP Static (High Tenacity Polyester) is a revolutionary new concept in static rescue ropes. HTP offers notable advantages over traditional nylon static ropes. Sterling's HTP is a super low elongation rope typically less than 2% of elongation at a load of 10% of its rated strength. The 48 carrier sheath provides greater durability than previously available, and yields ropes with a more supple hand, making it easier to deploy and bag up after rescue operations. The smooth sheath also feeds through pulley systems with less friction. Polyester offers greater resistance to UV light and certain chemicals (it is much better suited for acidic environments than nylon). The polyester fibers used to construct HTP ropes absorb much less water than will a nylon rope. HTP excels in lowering and extraction systems, and high line systems thanks to its super low elongation, high resistance to electr",1,,,,GS-07F-0100W,26.98,26.97,1,EA,ORIGIN,SEV01,180515,TW,,,,sevaphoto2.jpg
